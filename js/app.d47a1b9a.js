For example, "hello" and "hello!" are still different words to a computer. Sometimes it can be fine to remove the punctuation, but we might also need the punctuation to understand sentences.

Click below to mark punctuation and finish cleaning your string.',introToTokenisation:'Great job! You\'ve now cleaned your text into words and punctuation. This process is called "tokenisation", where we turn texts into lists of "tokens" which contribute to the meaning of the text. This is a key part, and usually the first step, for text processing in AI. While ours was reasonably effective, there were a few simplifications to make things easier. For example, the word "don\'t" would be split into the words "don" and "t", because of the punctuation, when we would probably want to treat it as one word or "do" and "not".

For example, is "don\'t" one word or two? Is New York a word? What about something like "!"? It\'s a difficult question to answer with rules, and therefore AIs typically split sentences by seeing lots of examples like you have just done, and noticing the patterns.

For one, we now know what words are the most common. This can help us understand what the text is about. For example, if we see "parrot" and "rabbit" a lot, we might guess the text is about animals. But as well as this, the unique words can tell us something. If we can see the word "enclosure" is used just once, we might guess that the text is about a zoo, rather than what pets people own. So, just by looking at the words without their sentences, we can still see hints for what the sentences were originally about. One limitation is that if we said we were NOT happy in a sentence, happy would be in our chart, and we\'d have no way of knowing it was supposed to be the opposite.',createBagOfWords:"A bag of words is a text processing technique which goes all the way back to the 1950s.

What can you think that this could be used for? One application was in email security, where for years Gmail used it to detect spam - because spammers would use words like "money", "now", "danger" much more than a regular email would. It\'s also worth thinking that although we are considering words individually, like "teams", "goals", "manager", if those individual words appear with the word "ball" we might assume those words are about football teams, goals and managers. But, the word "office" might make us think its about Microsoft teams, work goals, and managers. So words appearing together is also important, even though we lose the exact order by cutting the sentences up.',generateText:'We can already generate text now! Pick a number of words to draw, and pull them randomly out from the bag or pile. Even though our "sentence" might not make sense, we still generated new text. You can keep going until you run out of words, or add the word back every time to generate forever.',textGenerationAlt:"Example image of someone generating text from the bag of words",probabilities:"It can also be useful to consider the fact that theres actually a very small chance that you would pull out a sentence that went into the bag, in its exact order, and therefore generate a perfect (but unoriginal) sentence. Theres also a slightly bigger, but still small chance that you pull out something new that makes sense. We can think of the goal of text generation as being a task of increasing the probability that something new and that makes sense is generated based on our input data."}}}},da:{maskinrummet:"Maskinrummet",home:"Hjem",about:"Om",contact:"Kontakt",luke:"Luke Connelly",student:"Datalogi kandidatstuderende ved Aarhus Universitet",phoneNumber:"+45 93 87 34 09",email:"lukejconnelly1{'@'}gmail.com",welcome:"Velkommen til Maskinrummet!",welcomeText:'Dette er en undervisningsressource designet på Aarhus Universitet til at undervise i, hvordan tekstbehandling og AI-systemer fungerer<br><br>Lærere: vi håber, I kan bruge siden i jeres undervisning - vores aktiviteter giver eleverne mulighed for at arbejde praktisk med data og AI<br><br>Du må meget gerne <a href="/#/da/contact">kontakte os</a> med forslag, spørgsmål eller feedback!
