WHAT SHOULD THE ACTIVITY BE TITLED?

Embeddings: Words as data

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITY?

Teach the concept of embeddings through creating a table with binary values (e.g. the classic king/queen example)

Teach the idea of being able to summarise these through adding the table entries (e.g. Prince + Old = King)

Finally, teach similarity as distance between embeddings, first with a single word, then with summing of words

WHAT WILL USERS NEED BEFORE DOING THE ACTIVITY? WHAT RECOMMENDED MINIMUM AGE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE?

Understanding of geometric space quite important (e.g. distances), so perhaps 12+

WHAT ARE THE LEARNING GOALS AND OUTCOMES?

Users understand what an embedding is, how word similarity can work, how summarisation can be performed. Important
to point out the limitation that embedding vectors are not neat categories (e.g. masc/fem, old/young, royal/not)

WHAT IS THE MODALITY OF THE ACTIVITY? (ONLINE WITH A SHARED DATASET, SINGLE SENTENCE, OFFLINE, ETC.)

Could be done offline as a lesson, if wanting to use a model will need to be done in the browser or with huggingface

In an offline version could ask users to come up with their own word "sums" (e.g. Person - Old = Baby, Baby + Dog = Puppy)

IS THE ACTIVITY SUBJECT SPECIFIC? COULD IT BE GENERALISED?

Non-subject specific, but examples might need to be hardcoded?

HOW LONG DO YOU IMAGINE THE ACTIVITY WOULD TAKE?

Probably 45 minutes to an hour
